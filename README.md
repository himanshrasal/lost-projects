# lost-projects

**NOTE:** The source code for these projects is lost or unrecoverable. This repository exists to archive what the projects were.

A collection of my past projects where the original source code is lost, but functional demos or video proofs still exist. Preserved for documentation, inspiration, and archival purposes.

> ### Room Tour  
> A Unity-based room exploration project using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) with the Meta Quest 2.  
> 
> - Built to test HDRP in VR using Unity.  
> - All 3D models were created from scratch.  
> - Uses only free and redistributable PBR textures from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com) and other sources.  
>

> ### Logic Gates  
> A functional logic gate simulator using arithmetic and interaction in Unity, with working hand tracking for Meta Quest 2.  
> 
> - Simulates logic operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR.  
> - Uses hand gestures to toggle inputs and observe live output.  
> - Built using Unity XR Toolkit with gesture input and VR UI.

## Why Archive These?
Even without the source code, these projects:  
- Demonstrate technical implementation and creativity  
- Serve as a base for future rebuilds or case studies  
- Showcase working demos and functional proof of concepts

## Planned Additions
- Mobile and AR prototypes  
- More VR experiments
- Robotics and physical computing demos
