# lost-projects

**NOTE:** The source code for these projects is lost or unrecoverable. This repository exists to archive what the projects were.

A collection of my past projects where the original source code is lost, but functional demos or video proofs still exist. Preserved for documentation, inspiration, and archival purposes.

> ### Room Tour  
> A Unity-based room exploration project using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) with the Meta Quest 2.  
> 
> - Built to test HDRP in VR using Unity.  
> - All 3D models were created from scratch.  
> - Uses only free and redistributable PBR textures from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com) and other sources.  
>

> ### Logic Gates  
> A functional logic gate simulator using arithmetic and interaction in Unity, with working hand tracking for Meta Quest 2.  
> 
> - Simulates logic operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR.  
> - Uses hand gestures to toggle inputs and observe live output.  
> - Built using Unity XR Toolkit with gesture input and VR UI.

> ### ZELNA – Handheld AI Assistant  
> An offline AI assistant with voice capabilities and a touchscreen interface, running locally via a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.  
> 
> - Built with PyQt5 (GUI), Flask (backend), Vosk (STT), pyttsx3 (TTS), and Ollama (LLM).  
> - Uses a custom PCB for audio filtering and charging logic.  
> - Entirely offline — no internet or cloud dependencies.

> #### Internal Build  
>
> - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W  
> - 3.5-inch LCD display  
> - USB Microphone  
> - 2300mAh Lithium Battery  
> - Boost converter and TP4056 charging module  
> - PAM8403 audio amplifier  
> - Custom modules:  
>   - Low-pass RC filter for PWM audio  
>   - Charge detection using LM393 comparator IC

> ### Tools and Technologies Used  
>
> - Unity (HDRP / URP)  
> - Meta Quest 2 / Oculus SDK  
> - Unity XR Toolkit (hand tracking & VR input)  
> - Blender (3D modeling)  
> - Poly Haven textures (CC0)  
> - Python (PyQt5, Flask, Vosk, pyttsx3)  
> - Raspberry Pi (embedded hardware)  
>
> ---  
>
> ### Why Archive These?  
>
> Even without the source code, these projects:  
> - Demonstrate technical implementation and creativity  
> - Serve as a base for future rebuilds or case studies  
> - Showcase working demos and functional proof of concepts
